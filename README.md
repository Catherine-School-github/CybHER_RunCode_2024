A working contact directory that is to be used for the CybHER 2024 run code activity.
This code was made specifically to meet several criteria:
  1) Be split neatly into different sections that students can put back together
  2) Be simple enough in that students can understand at least most of what is happening, even if they don't specifically know what every line of code does
  3) Primairly use keywords and strategies taught in the python lessons at the CybHER 2024 Camp
  4) Be around 100 lines of code
  5) Be actually useful code that students might actually use, or at least see it's use
Though this code was primarily created to be used for the Run Code acitivty, it is fully working as a contact book and can be used as such.
